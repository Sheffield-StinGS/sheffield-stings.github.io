    <p>
        Sheffield Students in Guides and Scouts (Sheffield StinGS) is a university society, open to all students with an interest in Scouting or Guiding regardless of their membership in either organisation. We both help members find local volunteering opportunites and enable participation in national events.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are also a part of the Student Scout and Guide Organisation <a href="https://ssago.org" target="_blank">(SSAGO)</a> a national organisation, affiliated to both <a href="https://scouts.org.uk" target="_blank">The Scout Association</a> and <a href="https://girlguiding.org.uk/" target="_blank">Girlguiding UK</a>, with branches at universities all over the country.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have a dynamic and exciting weekly programme that includes a variety of activities, ranging from more traditional outdoor activities such as climbing and whittling to things like ice skating and baking.

        <p>
            As a student society we are run by a committee elected from within our membership each year at our Annual General Meeting (AGM). This means that any member can choose to become involved in the running of the society and help bring about changes.

        <p>
            As a SSAGO group we have several mascots that we take to events. They have been acquired from various places over the years and are attached to the various roles of the committee. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two types of mascot within SSAGO; stealable and non-stealable. Stealable mascots must be defended at national events, otherwise forfeits may be incurred.
